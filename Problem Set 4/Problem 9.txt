    Allow the user to play an arbitrary number of hands.
 
    1) Asks the user to input 'n' or 'r' or 'e'.
        * If the user inputs 'e', immediately exit the game.
        * If the user inputs anything that's not 'n', 'r', or 'e', keep asking them again.

    2) Asks the user to input a 'u' or a 'c'.
        * If the user inputs anything that's not 'c' or 'u', keep asking them again.

    3) Switch functionality based on the above choices:
        * If the user inputted 'n', play a new (random) hand.
        * Else, if the user inputted 'r', play the last hand again.
          But if no hand was played, output "You have not played a hand yet. 
          Please play a new hand first!"
        
        * If the user inputted 'u', let the user play the game
          with the selected hand, using playHand.
        * If the user inputted 'c', let the computer play the 
          game with the selected hand, using compPlayHand.

    4) After the computer or user has played the hand, repeat from step 1
